            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** This represents the \"standard\" corporate environment where there is enough capital to invest in AI, but also enough existing structure and risk to require a formal decision-making framework. It avoids the extremes of a resource-strapped three-person startup or a highly restricted government defense agency.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** These are currently the most accessible and sought-after forms of AI for general business applications. Most organizations asking this question are looking at how to leverage tools like ChatGPT or how to better use their existing data to predict customer behavior.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the AI in question is **Physical AI (Robotics)**, the decision shifts from software and data concerns to capital expenditures, physical workspace safety, and hardware maintenance. If it is **Autonomous Systems** (like self-driving vehicles), the ethical and legal liability becomes the primary factor in the \"whether\" decision.\n",

            "*   **Assumption:** The primary driver for the decision is **measurable ROI (Return on Investment)** balanced against **Data Security risks.**\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Most commercial organizations prioritize financial sustainability. A decision to adopt technology is rarely made without a business case that proves it will either save money (efficiency) or make money (revenue), provided it doesn't leak proprietary data.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the driver is **Competitive Parity (FOMO)**, the organization might skip the ROI analysis and decide to use AI simply because their competitors are doing so. If the driver is **Research & Development**, the organization may decide to use AI even if it loses money in the short term, viewing it as a long-term learning investment.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Building proprietary AI models from scratch is prohibitively expensive for most organizations. Most companies begin their AI journey by using existing software-as-a-service (SaaS) AI tools to improve internal workflows (e.g., HR, coding assistants, or customer support).\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If \"Use\" means **building a proprietary AI product to sell to customers**, the decision-making process must include market analysis, product-market fit, and long-term technical debt management, which are irrelevant for internal-only tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Assumption regarding \"How\" (to use)\n",
            "*   **Assumption:** \"How\" refers to the **Governance and Policy framework** (setting rules for employees and data usage).\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** For a modern organization, the biggest hurdle to \"how\" they use AI is not the technical installation, but the creation of an \"Acceptable Use Policy\" that protects the company from legal and ethical fallout.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If \"How\" refers to **Technical Implementation (Architecture)**, the decision-making focus shifts to IT infrastructure, cloud computing costs, and the specific data engineering pipeline required to feed the AI.

Without a defined framework, the advice given could be technically sound but practically or ethically irrelevant to the stakeholders.\n",

            "*   **Why it matters:** Cities vary drastically in terms of population density, existing public transit infrastructure, and legal authority. A decision-making process for New York City (which has high transit density) would look very different from a process for a sprawling city like Houston (where driving is often the only option). The geographical and legal constraints of the specific city change what is \"decidable.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "### 3. \"decide\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** This refers to the governance and procedural mechanism. \"Deciding\" could mean a top-down executive order by a mayor, a vote by a city council, a public referendum, or a mandate from a state or federal transit authority. The \"how\" of a public vote is vastly different from the \"how\" of a technical data analysis.\n",

            "\n",
            "### 4. \"congestion pricing\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** This is a broad term that covers many different systems. It could mean \"cordon pricing\" (charging to enter a specific zone), \"area pricing\" (charging to drive within a zone), \"corridor pricing\" (tolls on specific high-traffic roads), or \"dynamic/variable pricing\" (prices that change based on real-time traffic). Each has different costs, technological requirements, and public reception.\n",

            "*   **Why it matters:** Implementation can range from a permanent, multi-billion dollar infrastructure overhaul to a small-scale, six-month pilot program using mobile apps. The decision-making process for a permanent law is much more rigorous and high-stakes than the decision to run a temporary trial.\n",
