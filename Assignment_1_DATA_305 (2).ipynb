            "### 1. \"Organization\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** The decision-making process for a three-person non-profit is fundamentally different from that of a global financial institution or a government agency. Resources, risk tolerance, regulatory environments, and technical maturity vary wildly across different types of entities.\n",
            "*   **Clarifying Question:** What is the size, industry, and regulatory environment of the organization in question?\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. \"AI\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** \"AI\" is a broad umbrella term. Deciding to use a Generative AI chatbot for internal emails is a low-stakes decision compared to using predictive AI for medical diagnoses or autonomous systems for manufacturing. The \"how\" and \"whether\" depend entirely on the specific technology being discussed.\n",

            "\n",
            "### 3. \"Decide\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** It is unclear who the decision-makers are or what the success criteria are. Does \"decide\" refer to a financial cost-benefit analysis, a technical feasibility study, or an ethical review board’s approval?\n",
            "*   **Clarifying Question:** Who are the stakeholders involved in this decision, and what are the primary KPIs (e.g., ROI, risk mitigation, or speed to market) they are using to measure success?\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. \"Use\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** There is a major distinction between *building* custom AI models, *buying* enterprise software that has AI features, or simply *allowing* employees to use public AI tools. The governance and \"how\" of each scenario are distinct.\n",
            "*   **Clarifying Question:** Does \"use\" refer to internal operational improvements, external customer-facing products, or the procurement of third-party software?\n",

            "### 6. \"How\"\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Smaller organizations often lack the resources for formal \"decision frameworks,\" while government agencies have unique mandate-driven requirements. A mid-to-large enterprise represents the \"standard\" case where there is enough complexity to require a strategy, but enough resource flexibility to act.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the organization is a small non-profit or a startup, the decision process shifts from \"governance and risk\" to \"immediate survival and cost-efficiency.\" If it is a government body, the priority shifts from \"profit/market share\" to \"public service and equity.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Assumption on \"AI\"\n",
            "**Assumption:** \"AI\" refers primarily to **Generative AI (LLMs)** and **off-the-shelf Predictive Analytics** for business intelligence.\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** These are the most common entry points for organizations today. While \"robotics\" or \"autonomous systems\" are also AI, they are niche applications that require highly specialized hardware and safety protocols not applicable to the general business world.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the AI in question is specialized (e.g., autonomous manufacturing robotics), the decision-making process must prioritize physical safety, supply chain logistics, and high-capital expenditure, which are less relevant to software-based AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Assumption on \"Decide\"\n",
            "**Assumption:** The decision-making process is **centralized and driven by a cross-functional committee** (including IT, Legal, Finance, and Department heads) using a cost-benefit and risk-assessment framework.\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** In a professional setting, a single person rarely decides on technology that affects the entire enterprise. A cross-functional approach is the industry standard for reducing \"shadow AI\" and ensuring compliance.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the decision is decentralized (allowing individual teams to decide), the framework would focus on \"minimum safety standards\" rather than a unified corporate strategy.\n",

            "**Assumption:** \"Use\" refers to **integrating third-party AI tools or fine-tuning existing models** for internal productivity and customer-facing enhancements.\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Most organizations are not \"AI creators\" (building models from scratch like OpenAI or Google); they are \"AI consumers\" or \"AI tuners.\" Building from scratch is prohibitively expensive for most entities.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the organization intends to *build* its own foundation models, the decision framework must prioritize massive infrastructure investment, specialized talent acquisition, and vast data harvesting strategies.\n",

            "### 5. Assumption on \"Should\" (Normative Standard)\n",
            "**Assumption:** The \"Should\" is defined by **Commercial Viability and Responsible AI.** This means the decision must lead to a positive Return on Investment (ROI) while adhering to current legal regulations and basic ethical standards (e.g., bias mitigation).\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** For-profit organizations are bound by fiduciary duty to be profitable, but they are also increasingly held accountable by regulators (like the EU AI Act) and public perception.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If \"should\" is defined purely by \"profit at any cost,\" ethical and long-term risk assessments would be discarded. If \"should\" is purely \"altruistic,\" the organization might reject AI that displaces any labor, regardless of the business benefit.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** At an organizational level, \"how\" is rarely about the specific code; it is about the roadmap, the guardrails, and how the people within the organization will adapt to the new technology.\n",

            "### 1. “Congestion pricing”\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** Congestion pricing is not a single strategy; it encompasses various models such as **cordon pricing** (charging to enter a zone), **corridor pricing** (tolling specific roads), or **dynamic/variable pricing** (costs change based on real-time traffic). The criteria for deciding to use a toll lane on one highway are very different from the criteria for charging every car that enters a downtown core.\n",
            "*   **Clarifying Question:** What specific model of congestion pricing is being proposed, and what are the geographic boundaries of the pricing zone?\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. “City”\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** The term \"city\" can refer to the municipal government, the geographic urban area, or the entire metropolitan region including suburbs. A decision that benefits the \"city\" (the urban core) might negatively impact the \"region\" (commuters). Furthermore, the legal authority to implement such a plan varies depending on whether the city has \"home rule\" or is dependent on state/provincial approval.\n",
            "*   **Clarifying Question:** Does \"city\" refer to the municipal administration, and does that body have the legal jurisdiction to implement pricing without state or federal intervention?\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. “How should… decide”\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** This phrase is ambiguous regarding the **process** versus the **metrics**. It could be asking for a political process (e.g., a public referendum, a city council vote, or an executive order) or a technical framework (e.g., a cost-benefit analysis, environmental impact study, or equity audit).\n",
            "*   **Clarifying Question:** Are you seeking a political framework for stakeholder engagement and approval, or a technical framework based on data-driven KPIs?\n",

            "### 4. The implicit goal of the decision (The \"Why\")\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** The word \"decide\" implies a choice based on a goal, but the goal is unstated. If the goal is **revenue generation**, the decision hinges on fiscal projections. If the goal is **emissions reduction**, it hinges on environmental data. If the goal is **traffic speed**, it hinges on throughput metrics. Without a defined goal, \"deciding\" has no benchmark for success.\n",

The risks and decision-making criteria for a temporary trial are significantly lower than for a permanent infrastructure overhaul.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** This is the most common and comprehensive model used by major global cities (e.g., London, Stockholm, Singapore) when discussing city-wide policy. It generates the most significant debate regarding equity, commerce, and transit.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** To answer \"how a city should decide,\" we must assume the city has the agency to act. If the city has no power to implement the change, the question of \"how to decide\" is moot.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the city lacks legal jurisdiction (e.g., the state owns the roads), the decision-making process is no longer about policy implementation; it becomes a political lobbying strategy to convince a higher level of government to act.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Assumption: The \"Decision\" is based on a Technical-Analytical Framework.\n",
            "*   **The Assumption:** We assume the word \"decide\" refers to a **data-driven evaluation process** (utilizing KPIs and cost-benefit analyses) rather than a purely political process (like a public referendum).\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Professional urban planning typically requires a rigorous evidence-based approach to justify significant infrastructure and economic shifts to the public and stakeholders.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Most modern congestion pricing proposals are marketed as multi-purpose solutions. Focusing on just one (e.g., only revenue) is rare in modern urban policy due to political optics.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the goal is **purely revenue generation**, the city would set prices to maximize profit regardless of traffic flow. If the goal is **purely environmental**, the city might ignore revenue and focus on banning certain vehicle types altogether.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** High capital costs for enforcement technology (cameras, sensors) usually imply a permanent move, but successful precedents (like Stockholm) used a pilot to win public approval.\n",

            "*   **Why it matters:** The decision-making criteria for a multinational conglomerate (e.g., Apple or Toyota) are vastly different from those of a small family-owned business or a digital-first startup. Resources, risk tolerance, and existing infrastructure vary significantly by company size, industry, and maturity.\n",

            "### 2. \"Expand\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** \"Expansion\" is a broad term that can refer to many different entry strategies. A company might \"expand\" via low-risk exporting, medium-risk licensing or franchising, or high-risk Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) like building a factory abroad. Each requires a different level of capital and a different decision-making framework.\n",

            "*   **Why it matters:** Not all foreign markets are equal. Deciding to enter a \"near-market\" (culturally or geographically similar, like a U.S. company moving into Canada) involves different hurdles than entering an \"emerging market\" (with high volatility and different regulatory standards). The level of institutional distance dictates the complexity of the decision.\n",

One company \"should\" expand if their goal is immediate revenue growth, while another \"should\" stay local if their goal is risk mitigation or maintaining a domestic supply chain. Without a defined objective, the \"should\" is subjective.\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Small startups often lack the capital for formal international expansion, while massive multinational conglomerates already have established global frameworks. Mid-to-large enterprises face the most critical \"crossroads\" decisions regarding whether to step onto the global stage.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the company is a \"born-global\" digital startup, the decision process shifts from physical infrastructure and capital investment to digital localization, server scalability, and global user acquisition costs.\n",

            "### Assumption 2: Expansion involves a Moderate-to-High Commitment Entry Mode\n",
            "*   **The Assumption:** We assume \"expand\" refers to a strategy involving significant resource commitment, such as a Joint Venture (JV), licensing, or establishing a physical subsidiary (Foreign Direct Investment), rather than simple passive exporting.\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Passive exporting (e.g., fulfilling international orders via a website) requires very little strategic \"decision-making.\" A formal framework is most necessary when the company must commit significant personnel, capital, and brand reputation to a foreign market.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the expansion is low-risk (e.g., selling through a third-party global distributor), the decision-making process becomes almost entirely focused on logistics, shipping costs, and legal compliance rather than strategic market fit.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Assumption 3: The Target Market is an \"Emerging Market\" or \"Distal Market\"\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Expanding from the U.S. to Canada or from Germany to Austria involves minimal friction. The \"should\" of the decision is only truly tested when the company must navigate complex barriers, such as entering a market like India, Brazil, or Vietnam.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the target is a \"near-market\" (culturally and geographically similar), the decision-making process simplifies into a basic cost-benefit analysis, as cultural adaptation and regulatory hurdles are negligible.\n",

            "### Assumption 4: The Primary Goal is Long-Term Revenue Growth and Diversification\n",

            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** While companies expansion for many reasons, the most common strategic driver is the need to find new customer bases to ensure long-term survival and satisfy shareholders.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If the goal is purely \"asset-seeking\" (e.g., expanding to secure cheaper raw materials or specialized talent), the decision-making criteria shift from \"market demand and competition\" to \"supply chain efficiency and labor laws.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "### Assumption 5: The Decision Process requires a \"Hybrid\" Framework\n",
            "*   **The Assumption:** We assume the \"decide\" process must include both quantitative financial modeling (e.g., NPV, ROI) and qualitative strategic analysis (e.g., PESTEL, CAGE Distance Framework).\n",
            "*   **Why it is reasonable:** Financials alone cannot account for political instability or cultural rejection of a brand, and qualitative analysis alone cannot justify the capital expenditure to a Board of Directors. A rigorous answer requires balancing both.\n",
            "*   **What changes if false:** If only a quantitative framework is used, the company risks a \"numbers-only\" failure where the math looks good but the local culture rejects the product. If only qualitative, the company risks \"strategic vanity\" projects that lose money despite being a \"good fit.\"\n"

            "### 1. \"Modify\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** The word \"modify\" is highly broad. It could range from a minor technical tweak (e.g., adding \"minus\" grades to an existing A-B-C scale) to a fundamental pedagogical shift (e.g., moving from a 4.0 GPA scale to a narrative-based or Pass/Fail system). The criteria for making a small change are much lower than the criteria for a total overhaul.\n",

            "### 2. \"Grading system\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** It is unclear if this refers to the **output** (the final letter grade on a transcript), the **process** (how individual professors calculate points), or the **policy** (grading on a curve versus absolute standards). Furthermore, it is unclear if this applies to all departments equally; for example, a medical school’s grading needs differ significantly from a fine arts department’s needs.\n",

            "### 3. \"Determine\"\n",
            "*   **Why it matters:** This term refers to the decision-making process. \"Determining\" could involve a top-down mandate from the administration, a democratic vote by the faculty senate, or a data-driven approach based on student performance metrics and post-graduation employment rates.

            "*   **What changes if it is false:** If \"grading system\" refers to the internal methods professors use to assess work (e.g., requiring all faculty to use labor-based grading), the determination process must focus on faculty training, academic freedom, and disciplinary differences rather than registrar-level policy.\n",
